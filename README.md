This fun math game is designed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It challenges the user to try to figure out the value of each crystal and the user is expected to use those value to get a sum equal to the random number the user is suppose to match. What makes this mini-game challenging is that the value of each crystal randomizes everytime the user starts over.
